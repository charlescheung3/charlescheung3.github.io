    Hello stranger, my name is Charles Cheung. I am currently studying computer science at Hunter College. 
    If everything goes right, I should graduate around May 2022. This is my first attempt at a website, 
    just looking to practically implement everything I've learned so far. Hope you enjoy your stay here :D
